## Submission Instructions

### Overview
For my project, I am building a web application to help in planning and executing pinball tournaments.  Generating customer engagement and repeat business are key areas of focus for local venues such as Lowry Parcade and The Replay Museum.  An application which allows venues to create and market promotions to local customers would help with this aim.
### Features
1.Create account/user login:  Users should be able to create a profile to identify themselves when registering for an event.  Could also be used to individually track results, scores, rankings, etc.
2.Create event:  Event organizers/venue managers should be able to create events to market to local players, giving date, time, location information in a searchable database.
3. Search:  Players should be able to search for local events by location, by date, and perhaps other factors as time allows.
4. Register:  Players should be able to RSVP for events so that organizers can plan effectively.
5. Results Tracking:  Player profiles should include information on completed events, possibly to include scoring, rankings, etc.
### Technologies
C#
.NET
Entity Framework

### What I'll Have to Learn
I’ll need to figure out how to implement some of the results tracking and player ranking features I haven’t quite fleshed out completely in my head.  I also want to create calls to Google Maps API to provide a functional and visually pleasing display of search results by location.  There are probably other features, such as social media integration that I would like to add as appropriate/possible using API.
